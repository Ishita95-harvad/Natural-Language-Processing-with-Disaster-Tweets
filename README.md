# 🔍 Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Welcome to **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets**! This repository focuses on applying **NLP techniques** to classify tweets related to disasters, helping organizations filter emergency-related content from general chatter.

## 📌 Dataset Overview
- 🆘 **Disaster-Related Tweets:** Identifying tweets mentioning floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.  
- 🤖 **Text Classification:** Using NLP models to detect emergency relevance  
- 📊 **Sentiment & Context Analysis:** Understanding urgency and emotional impact
